<br />
i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual:
either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i
can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i
forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the
simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater
salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i
know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to
make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy
way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year
old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to
only wear leather shoes dress shoes.<br />

about you:<br />
<br />
you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about
really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a
light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you
have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons
with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still
at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the
wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my
favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a
good attention span.","currently working as an international agent for a freight

38,"thin","anything","socially","","graduated from masters program","i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online
dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as
earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before
the world.<br />
<br />
i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find
myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and
acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on
this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that
aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a
friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex
filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle
statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text
without moving quickly on to another search result, you are
probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at
first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid
you, but that seems silly.<br />
<br />
as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of
the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you
get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that
while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and
by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that
way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself
gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are
too.","i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to
indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from
the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more
concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual
form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance,
noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at
least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven
activities, i've been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi
to try and gently flirt with ego death.","improvising in different contexts. alternating between being
present and decidedly outside of a moment, or trying to hold both
at once. rambling intellectual conversations that hold said
conversations in contempt while seeking to find something that
transcends them. being critical while remaining generous. listening
to and using body language--often performed in caricature or large
gestures, if not outright interpretive dance. dry, dark, and
raunchy humor.","my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people
comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an
unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more
directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i'll come back
to this.","okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific, it's like
being in the crosshairs.<br />
<br />
for what it's worth, i find myself reading more non-fiction than
fiction. it's usually some kind of philosophy, art, or science text
by silly authors such as ranciere, de certeau, bataille,
baudrillard, butler, stein, arendt, nietzche, zizek, etc. i'll
often throw in some weird new age or pop-psychology book in the mix
as well. as for fiction, i enjoy what little i've read of eco,
perec, wallace, bolao, dick, vonnegut, atwood, delilo, etc. when i
was young, i was a rabid asimov reader.<br />
<br />
directors i find myself drawn to are makavejev, kuchar, jodorowsky,
herzog, hara, klein, waters, verhoeven, ackerman, hitchcock, lang,
gorin, goddard, miike, ohbayashi, tarkovsky, sokurov, warhol, etc.
but i also like a good amount of ""trashy"" stuff. too much to
name.<br />
<br />
i definitely enjoy the character development that happens in long
form episodic television over the course of 10-100 episodes, which
a 1-2hr movie usually can't compete with. some of my recent tv
favorites are: breaking bad, the wire, dexter, true blood, the
prisoner, lost, fringe.<br />
<br />
a smattered sampling of the vast field of music i like and deejay:
art ensemble, sun ra, evan parker, lil wayne, dj funk, mr. fingers,
maurizio, rob hood, dan bell, james blake, nonesuch recordings,
omar souleyman, ethiopiques, fela kuti, john cage, meredith monk,
robert ashley, terry riley, yoko ono, merzbow, tom tom club, jit,
juke, bounce, hyphy, snap, crunk, b'more, kuduro, pop, noise, jazz,
techno, house, acid, new/no wave, (post)punk, etc.<br />
<br />
a few of the famous art/dance/theater folk that might locate my
sensibility: andy warhol, bruce nauman, yayoi kusama, louise
bourgeois, tino sehgal, george kuchar, michel duchamp, marina
abramovic, gelatin, carolee schneeman, gustav metzger, mike kelly,
mike smith, andrea fraser, gordon matta-clark, jerzy grotowski,
samuel beckett, antonin artaud, tadeusz kantor, anna halperin,
merce cunningham, etc. i'm clearly leaving out a younger generation
of contemporary artists, many of whom are friends.<br />

forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? this
works in the same way. if you are not consciously there to hear it,
see it, taste it, smell it, feel it none of this matters, it's
still there. pay attention to the little things, those that are
often overlooked. see if you can find the magic in this gift we
call life.","plotting to take over the world with my army of segway riding

three years ago for a combination of work opportunity and just
wanting to live in sf. it took me a couple years to get to the
peninsula, but i'm glad i eventually got here. i'm passionate about
people and have a wide variety of interests and talents.<br />
<br />
i'm also continually learning about myself. for example, i'm
learning very recently that as a result of spending all my time
growing up, in college, and for the last five years focusing on
growing my ""deep relationship"" skills, i'm not as good as i
previously thought at initializing friendships/relationships. i
guess that isn't all a bad thing since the ""first impression"" thing
only really happens once with each person. :)<br />
<br />
as a result, i love my friends, i've got a lot of deep friendships,
and know how much richer a friendship can get as it gets
deeper.<br />
<br />
i'm passionate about music, i play the guitar, write songs (less
now than before), write plays (more now than before), want to learn
french and asl, am pretty good for an amateur ballroom dancer, can
do almost everything moderately well (seriously, no joke), love
bright ties and shoes, am a jacket and jeans person, and absolutely
love figuring out how people tick. i think i'm pretty cool and wish
more people would be patient enough to take the time to see
that.<br />
<br />
every friend i've ever had say i'm nothing like anyone else. so i
don't come off like anyone else. i'm my own person. and i'm proud
of that.","i'm currently the youngest member on an internal strategy team for
a large bank. it may sound boring, but i'm a big fan of the
opportunities it entails. i get to be exposed to really
intelligent, deliberately organized people be purposeful in a high
paced business environment. it's pretty awesome soaking up all
their knowledge while contributing what i can.<br />
<br />
i'm happy with who i am and would enjoy adding someone else to the
mix.","i'm really good at a little bit of everything. there isn't much i
truly excel in, but i'm above average to good in almost every area.
i take pride in being able to do a lot of different things. for
example, i have a tiny bit of talent/skill in writing,
wood-carving, cooking, singing, playing a guitar, drawing, sewing,
etc. i grew up in a household that had to make a lot of the things
we needed, so you kind of picked up these things along the way.","the way i dress. some days it's hats, other days it's different
ties. most days it's shoes and jackets. just another way to express
myself.<br />
<br />
i've also decided that people notice how i'm not what they
expected. i find myself unpurposefully continually surprising
people, and i think i like that. :)","books = yes. avid reader.<br />

don't even really play video games all that often. i actually

only knew one person in this area when i moved here, but i wasn't

lifestyle. i'm really looking forward to doing some camping,
backpacking, biking, etc in ca. i also really enjoy going out for a
nice meal and some tasty cocktails or beer, or doing the music
nightlife thing. i dj (drum n bass) from time to time, and i've

somewhat vulgar flare (i hope you can take a joke-offensive or
not).<br />
<br />
i'm a constant seeker of discovering something new, whether it be a
different restaurant, culture, or music (anything really). i tend
to have an eclectic personality.<br />
<br />
i volunteer and participate with a lot of activities with my
community. i also tend to seek those who have a story, any story.
i'm all ears! i want to learn from you, hear what you have to say,

i'm a bit of a nerd and like to watch the history, military, and

me.<br />

rationally thinking. i find this to be extremely rare

crave discovery and self knowledge, so in a sense i'm good at
figuring things out on my own.","physically-i've been told my eyes. people usually like how i can
turn a serious situation into something relaxing and fun. i tend to

favorite actress : rachel weise. favorite director: darren
aronofsky . that should give you a pretty good idea of the type of

i absolutely love to dance! nothing is a better stress reliever
than hitting the dance floor with good company.<br />
<br />
hands down though, my ultimate love affair with music is
essentially classic rock. the scorpions are absolutely my favorite
band because they bring a smile to my face every time i hear them.

i am looking for many things: friendships, drinking/hiking/sports
buddies, love interests, adventure partners, business
opportunities... you name it. i am a social animal and appreciate
human interaction, so i am always interested in meeting new people
regardless of ""who"" or ""what"" they are. in practice, and in
mannerisms, i seem like quite the ""typical"" guy: i love to drink
beer, play sports, i listen to reggae, dubstep and hip-hop, and
enjoy a beach full of bikini-clad women as much as anyone. however,
yes, i can also be a bisexual, swinging, polyamorous, and
debaucherous individual. but that is just a part of me, and all
that really means anyway is i'm open minded. i have always fully
imagined marrying and having kids one day, but i'm open to whatever
life may bring. while i am secretly and totally a hopeless
romantic, i am not trying to rush in to things or grow up too
fast.<br />
i strive in my daily life to be relaxed and down-to-earth, but
still adventurous... i try not to take the day-to-day of life too
seriously. :-)<br />
<br />
a note on ""bisexuality"":<br />
for you hetero-normative folk: do not be afraid of the term
""bisexual"". it is just a term, and a very limiting one at that. i
am just as heterosexual as a ""straight man"". i am just as
homosexual as a ""gay"" man. and just because i may be bisexual and
perhaps polyamorous, does not mean that i am unable to be in a
happy, committed, and fulfilling relationship with a single
partner. in fact, such an arrangement has been my norm.","i am living. bartending, schooling, rocking out to my radio...

by day, i'm a mild-mannered designer in an office. by evening, an
inventor, artist, and adventurer. by night, a competition dancer
and jet-setter to fun and glamour.<br />
<br />
""oh - you're a designer?"" you say. ""that's interesting!"" you lie.
exactly! ""designer"" is a great thing to be, because you can put it
on forms and stuff to answer the ""what do you do?"" question without
actually answering it. ""designer"" tells you nothing. i could be
working in fashion, cars, systems, furniture, ads, events,
landscapes, websites, aircraft, or anything! ""ah yes, very clever,
haha etc etc. so what kind of designer are you then?"" well, some of
you reading this will have purchased my work. that kind of designer
:-p","most things :-p","the first thing people usually <i>comment</i> on is my accent. i
sound british to most americans, australian to some, but while
these are good guesses, neither is quite correct.<br />
<br />
someone else's summary of me: ""he is not only hot as hell, but he
is the gayest straight man in the world - he has good taste, knows
how to decorate, has a real sense of style"".<br />
<br />
clearly she completely failed to notice my impressive aura of
menace and seductive evil radiating across the land. actually,
no-one seems to notice it. i think my aura might be broken.<br />
<br />
a friend i met on this site just called me ""a rare gem in the
wasteland of okstupid"". i hope there is a gem around here somewhere
for me!","i like books &amp; movies &amp; music, just like you!<br />
<br />
i'm not actually much of a believer in seeking out only people that
you have lots in common with. it might be easier to go on a date if
you're both always wanting to see the same movies, but i think the
really great times are often the ones where you end up doing
something you've never done before (and never dreamed you would),
because the other person's different interests give you access to
worlds that you probably wouldn't stumble into without them.
through each other, you both end up more magnificent!","i have whatever is the opposite of chronic depression - i am pretty
much hardwired to remain happy, regardless of what is going down.
so i figure i won at least one of life's major lotteries.<br />
<br />
on a different tack, i once lost mobility due to my leg being
sliced open when i accidentally... er... i mean... in the midst of
battle while i was fending off dozens of those bad guys from the
lord of the rings films. yeah - dozens! anyway, i got so sick of
not being able to do stuff, that i eventually ended up at a big new
year's bash a few weeks later, dancing through the painkillers,
doing my leg no favours, but having a blast. thus, i think dancing
would probably be on the list. as to the other four things, they're
classified. may i see your security clearance please? wait - you're
telling me you don't have a security clearance? sir/maam, this is a
restricted area. if you would like clearance, you will need to step
over here for the security screening...","i like the often refreshingly blunt and uncomfortable insights
about us that are laid bare by oktrends.<br />
<br />
on the subject of oktrends, you might notice that my profile says
i'm 6'2"" tall. but if we measure in okcupid inches, i'm nearly
6'4""! we know this because oktrends cleverly deduced that men here
inflate their height by an average of 2"", while i happen to know
that i only inflated mine by a fraction of an inch, so as to get a
round number. (clearly i'm a rebel, living dangerously! or
something).","once upon a time i might have been out conversing and dining with
friends, but then i moved here where i don't know anyone. perhaps
i'd be out dancing somewhere. perhaps at home, working on secret
projects. ask me.","you wouldn't believe me anyway, so nevermind. :-p<br />
<br />
random fact: i was bitten by a (presumably) radioactive insect,
exploring the exclusion zone at chernobyl. any day now i'll
discover my super-powers. any day...<br />
<br />
another (not very) secret:<br />
i get lower auto insurance premiums than you - despite being male
and having a (very) fast car. how is that fair? well, there's a
trick to it...<br />
but i plan to get an electric car and build my own solar powerplant
to help fuel it. (i've done a bunch of smaller solar projects. i
love the permanence of it - building something that can run forever
- the other parts will fail before the power source does.)","you're participating in the human trials of the oragenics
bacteria<sup>(1)</sup> - i would totally snog<sup>(2)</sup> someone
with that stuff in their mouth; a life of crime doesn't get much
sexier than stealing the latest experimental biotech via steamy
french kiss, and committing swathes of intellectual property
infringements with tongues entwined.<br />
<br />
<sup><small><i><b>(1)</b> oragenics is an experimental version of
the bacteria that causes tooth decay, but engineered to out-compete
(and thus kill) the normal strain, while at the same time, not
creating tooth decay. in theory, the new strain should stop decay

<br />
did i visit your profile more than once but not send you a message?
that's because email is a pretty lousy way to try to meet someone,
so i figure i'll give it a few days to see if we happen to end up
online at the same time, and can thus contact you via the chat
feature instead. but if you don't plan to log in much or if you
prefer to disable chat, i supposed you should message me to tell me

and have your own views on topics instead of blindly following
social conventions.<br />
<br />
you have made mistakes in your life. you learn from them and move
on.<br />
<br />
you are beautiful inside and out. not in the stuart smalley ""i'm
good enough and i'm smart enough and gosh darnit, people like me""
way. you know from the depth of your being that you are an amazing
individual and you're looking for someone who can appreciate
everything you are. you probably still worry sometimes about what
people think of you, but that's only because you surround yourself
with other intelligent, creative, interesting, physically fit
people like yourself. who doesn't occasionally get intimidated in
that company?<br />
<br />
you appreciate the physical beauty of the human body. you are a
very sensual being. human touch is very important. hugs, kisses,
massage, and sex. people skirt around the topic of sex all the
time, but lets face it, sex is a very important aspect of a
relationship for someone like you or me and there's no point
wasting our time in a situation where the sex is less than
phenominal. i'm excited to hear about your turn-ons and
fantasies.<br />
<br />
money is not really an issue for you - not because you're obscenely
rich, that's not really important. i just mean that you have no
trouble making the life you want for yourself. you appreciate that
we are a very gifted, fortunate people to live as we do.<br />
<br />
you give back to this wonderful community you live in.<br />
<br />
you love to keep in shape by doing things, as opposed to just going
to the gym for an hour a day. mt biking, rock climbing, surfing,
kite surfing, running, hiking, snowshoeing, telemark, snowboarding,
road biking, swimming, tai chi, qigong, and yoga all sound
interesting to you even though you haven't tried them all yet.
maybe you won't even like all of them, but at least you're excited
to give them all a try.<br />
<br />
you are not a serial monogomist. you are independent and
comfortable being alone. it's fun to date and meet new people, but
you're not going to settle for anything less than you deserve.
ultimately you crave a relationship you can commit to for the rest
of your life. you are looking for a loving relationship based on
good communication and trust.<br />
<br />
eventually you might want a family, but you're in no hurry.","white",71,60000,"construction / craftsmanship","2012-06-30-00-01","san francisco, california","doesn&rsquo;t have kids","straight","likes dogs","agnosticism but not too serious about it","m","gemini and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","no","english (okay), french (poorly), spanish (poorly), c++ (okay)","single"

normal routine and have found decent long term relationships, but
have yet to find the right one.<br />
<br />
i'm not looking for games or ridiculous drama. i'm a pretty
straight forward guy that values honesty and good communication.
when i find the right person, i'm very devoted and sincere -- and i
hope to find the same in a partner.<br />

to zoning out in front of a good movie, to exploring some
previously unexplored land -- or just an unexplored road. i like
cooking or baking when i have someone to share that with, and
really i'm up for trying most new things.<br />
<br />
i value intelligence and insightful conversation. i love when i
meet someone who is passionate about a subject i know little about.
i'm happy debating almost anything even if it means playing devil's
advocate. critical thought and logic are a big part of how i've
grown up and defined myself and my beliefs.<br />
<br />
and then, of course, i also need to be able to let my guard down
and have fun making bad jokes or indulging in some offhand sarcasm.
to be able to let the little kid out who is fascinated poking
around in tide pools and also amused by the jelly bean dispenser
that ""poops"" the candy ... that's what keeps life fun and
beautiful.<br />

last think i have to say is, along with not caring for games, i
have no need for conventions and am very open minded. feel free to
contact me if i simply haven't managed to notice you yet, if you're
so inclined. it's flattering and a big plus in my book when someone

i'm the did you know guy: i'm always researching and analyzing.
if i know a friend is working on a project i'll send them relevant
ideas and articles i come across. however, my intellectual prowess
doesn't permeate to all aspects of my life. my friends make fun of
me for being an absent-minded-professor type. give me hard problem
and i'll excel, but moving out of my apartment? it might as well be
rocket science. eek, there's always room for improvement!<br />

i love the sound of plane tires touching down in a country i've
never visited. japan is next on my list, though i'd visit germany
or london again in a heartbeat.<br />

there's a more intuitive side to my life, too. recently i've been
enthusiastically exploring buddhism and meditation, paying
attention to the spaces in between things. the more i learn the
less i know. it's so refreshing to be awash in the mystery of the
universe.<br />

music: i love all types of music from classic rock to folk, hip-hop
&amp; some rap to oldies &amp; funk, modern rock and occasionally
drawn to electronica or dance. the beatles, crosby stills nash
&amp; young, janis joplin, led zeppelin, alice in chains, inxs,
weezer, the offspring, audioslave, 311, stp, velvet revolver,
metallica, red hot chili peppers, system of a down, tool, mason

clinton, cammeo, hussulah, mac dre, dre dog, too short &amp;

<br />
food: i am a healthy eater naturally. i really try to avoid
franchise or chain restaurants at all costs - simply because i find
them horribly impersonal and they give me flashbacks of my many
days as a serving robot. i love to find the mom &amp; pops type
small restaurants that serve large portions of food i can neither
pronounce or recreate at home. these are nearly extinct in silicon
valley so i generally choose to cook at home and love the
atmosphere it creates. good friends, a bottle of wine, music,
laughter and hot food sizzling on the stove is my idea of a perfect
friday evening.","love<br />

about being too sentimental, and for a long time she believed them.

compassion bright sweaters, explained the slang, showed her how to

the new york times who took so much longer than their parents did
to get their lives together. thankfully, things have progressed
magnificently in the last couple years, and i'm proud to say that i
again feel cool enough for online dating.<br />
<br />
i'm in a master's program for counseling psychology and am entering
my second year of clinical training, which means i am actually
being entrusted with the emotional well-being of strangers. it is
astonishing, profound, peculiar, transformational work that i find
deeply gratifying. but don't worry: i've retained my taste for the
absurd, and eventually do tire of talking about feelings.<br />
<br />
because everything sounds better in list-form, the following are
some arbitrarily chosen facts about myself:<br />
<br />
(1) i can win staring contests with cats.<br />
(2) in my off-hours i read, exercise, converse, study, garden,
meditate, do <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=arty+things"">arty
things</a>, and plan lots of projects that i only sometimes start
and almost never finish.<br />
(3) i own three chess sets, but don't play chess.<br />
(4) in people, i like a precise mix of church giggles and
smoldering contemplation; my friends, failing to achieve the
impossible, tend to gravitate dramatically toward one extreme or
the other.<br />
(5) i am deeply offended by bad art, and i'm not sure why.<br />
(6) i am not above eating an entire plate of kale and then going to
smoke a cigarette.<br />
(7) i can yawn without moving my face.<br />
(8) i have a contradictory blend of intense compassion and utter
self-absorption.<br />
(9) i enjoy silence, but not in elevators.<br />
(10) i have been a beginning yoga student for 8 years.<br />
(11) i can never seem to stand up straight, but when i do: watch
out. my height has been described by some as ""gangly"" and others as
""elven"", which to me are two very different things. i have also
been told i resemble a ""bundle of sticks.""<br />
(12) my best friend once told me that if i turned out to be a
figment of her imagination she wouldn't be surprised, which we
agreed was both an enormous compliment and a colossal insult.<br />
(13) my pet peeves include people who make noise in movie theaters,
a lopsided pasta/sauce ratio, and those who take a really long time
in single-occupancy public restrooms even though they know others
are waiting because the door handle has jiggled like seven times.
also, i think people who feel they're too good to bag their own
groceries are disgusting.<br />
(14) ""winged migration"" has been in my netflix queue for 4
years.<br />
(15) i have 35 plants in my room, a la max from where the wild
things are.<br />
(16) i am happy with my life, and it'd be swell to share it with
someone.<br />
(17) i don't talk about myself this much in person.","announcing my place in the family of things.","making photographs, empathy, being single, making and breaking

in germany (fellowship at the german bundestag + ma in economics,
in berlin and freiburg, respectively). currently living in napa,
working at an upscale winery while applying for positions in
economic research, although i'm frequently in sf.<br />
<br />
though i enjoy my forays into the castro, i don't like to play by
or to the stereotypes of 'the scene'. a focus on other interests is
more interesting, as gay professionals (/academics) rather than
professional gays. authenticity and straightforwardness are
attractive; role-stereotypes aren't (including the need to be
'straight-acting'). just be.<br />
<br />
great expectations (mostly for myself) aside, i'm actually more
easy-going and play well with others. i've recently been described
by a straight buddy as being perfectly comfortable living life as
both a gay bachelor and a straight ex-fratboy -- i'm not entirely
sure where he got the fratboy bit, but i think i know what he
meant.","i've earned my ba in political science and my ma in economics, and
while working in the wine industry to pay bills, i'm otherwise
looking at jobs in quantitative evaluation (frustrating in this
market) and phd programs in development economics. my sojourn into
'the dismal science' began more out of a sense of necessity, but
it's since become a preferred approach. i like all things
politically and economically behavioral generally, integrating a
mix of political/social psychology and political economy/public
choice. ultimately i'd like to land in a research/advisory role in
either some para-statal organization (e.g., the international bank
for reconstruction and development) or in academia. perhaps
teach.<br />
<br />
i'm otherwise becoming more of an oenophile, developing a palate
for wines i won't be able to afford once leaving the industry.
trying to get back into distance running. and lookin' for love in
all the wrong places.","what i'm really good at is for others to decide. but i do know that
i really enjoy languages, classical music (background in choral
singing), trail- and distance-running, watching and playing soccer,
hiking, camping, traveling, etc. all in no particular order.","","as for books, i've been trying to (re-)read some of the literary
classics: austen's emma and pride and prejudice, chopin's the
awakening, homer's the odyssey, faulkner's a light in august,
hugo's les miserables, morrison's beloved and twain's the
adventures of huckleberry finn. on a lighter note, i love
frankfurt's on bullshit.<br />
<br />
as for movies, i think film can be an awesome medium for ideas and
emotions. i tend to prefer dramas carrying some meaning, typically
without the canned happy endings. i like things that provide food
for thought, rather than clean and prefabricated conclusions:
nowhere in africa, the lives of others, we don't live here anymore,
the hours, before sunset, the talented mr. ripley, doubt, the time
that remains, elizabeth, the reader. of course, i like political
thrillers as well: the hunt for red october, the contender, the
bourne trilogy, etc.<br />
<br />
in the last ten years i've not had a tv more often than not, and i
appreciated the greater freedom it allowed me. i feel better
watching or listening to news shows like the news hour or morning
edition or all things considered. still, i like to be entertained:
i love watching the bundesliga or champions league matches, giants
games, the west wing, will &amp; grace and ncis.<br />
<br />
as for music, the full gamut: from hip hop/rap to r&amp;b to
jazz/bluegrass to rock to classical/choral/opera, etc. weezer, the
postal service, jason mraz, the offspring, miles davis, keith
jarrett, nickel creek, nina simone, dvorak, brahms, mahler,
vivaldi, verdi.<br />
<br />
foodwise: indian, thai, ethiopian, mexican, italian, mediterranean,
french, some german. i'm rather easy to please.","","","","","you're authentic and capable of genuine and direct communication
without cajoling. i'm not looking for shakespeare, but rather for
someone who has the occasional wit and candor to transcend the
pedestrian or banal. if you happen to scintillate 24-7, that's
awesome, but it's not expected. if you're one of the ""i avoid
politics""-types, it's not likely to work: i'm not looking for
walking policy wonks, but some modicum of interest in and awareness
of what's happening in the world is important to me. and, while
self-assuredness and confidence are attractive, so is an
understanding of humility and of hubris. not to mention a sense of
humor.<br />

i'm kind of a goofball, but in a subtle ways for the most part. dry
humour, sarcasm. i guess i just find humour/interest in many things
that most people don't even notice. i'm quirky...but endearingly so
(or so people say). i spend a lot of time looking for new (to me,
anyway) music to add to my collection, looking for interesting
events/activities/hobbies to try out around the city and revising
mental maps of where i'd like to end up eventually. i love hunting
for just the right vintage pieces. naturally, i'm an etsy whore,
and can be found perusing vintage furniture stores, especially the
alameda county antique fairs. my most recent vintage purchase was a
gorgeous grundig majestic record console, i do believe it's my
favourite piece of furniture i own now.<br />
<br />
i like trying out cozy new places to eat, and new recipes, but i'm
not by any stretch of the mind a 'foodie'. i frequent wine bars and
coffee shops, bay area staples. i _love_ the beach...i totally
appreciate being relatively close to the beach, after having lived
in ny, where the beach was neither close to the city nor
worthwhile. i like finding fun new ways of being active, like
finding new trails to jog, paths to bike or walls to climb. going
on spontaneous adventures is one of my favourite things to do, and
a fun way to get to know people. i love all things creative, so art
walks, gallery openings, live performances, museums, activities
that involve creating art, are all places that i tend to gravitate
towards...and i'm always looking for more people to that are also
into these kinds of events.<br />
<br />
i'm into technology, particularly mobile, which is the industry i
work in. it's a long story as to how i got here, but it's where i
want to be and i actually don't hate my job. i tweet and facebook.
and read tech blogs like engadget and gigaom to keep up with the
current goings on with the latest gadgets. but, i also read
magazines like juxtapoz, big up, etc. because i love them and for
the way it offsets the techier stuff in my line up.<br />
<br />
when it comes to friends, i'm super loyal and i think respect is
important. bad communication in any relationship, friendship or
otherwise is the kiss of death in my opinion, and a personal pet
peeve of mine. i like to be as up front as possible in most
situations...even if that's not what the person wants to
hear.<br />
<br />
eventually, i'd love to settle down with someone who i really
enjoy, respect, and feel a strong connection with. ideally, i'd
like for that person to be pretty different from me, into their own
scene, but still have some interests overlap with mine. i don't
really like to rush into dating, but when i find someone i like, i
tend to want to spend time, and get to know them. i'm a cuddler.
and a hand holder. and a just because-er. and likely, a
professional grade spooner. although dating-wise, this past year
has been very mismatched for me, as it seems that i haven't been
into the people that have been into me, and vice versa. hopefully
eventually, a mutual dig will occur...i wouldn't settle for
anything less.<br />

squirrels. squirrels get up to some funny shit. i love to read and
can easily spend hours in a good bookstore. i'm a huge cinephile
and in the right mood can enjoy a bad movie every bit as much as a
good one  see my aforementioned enjoyment of the ridiculous. i'm a
fan of hugs and backrubs  giving or getting. i strongly support
women's rights and gay rights and all other forms of social
equality. if you don't, we might not get along so well. just
sayin'. i love music but i also appreciate a good stretch of
silence every now and then. i love collecting information about how
things work and can happily geek out over some obscure facet of
biology, physics, psychology, history, or anthropology. i enjoy the
outdoors even though i don't get out as often as i'd like to,

figuring out why the universe is the way it is, why society is how

incorrect variant of chess ever. 4 colors/sides, each representing

brown pawns could explode killing nearby units, red pawns could
establish ""reservations"", and black had no king/queen but their
pawns could ""reproduce"" fast to spawn more black pawns. if that

the question:<br />
<strong>""to you, which adjective best describes hopeless,
unrequited love?""<br />
1. creepy<br />
2. foolish<br />
3. romantic</strong><br />
<em>this question, like most of these questions, is poorly written,
but offers up a very interesting incite into who's paying
attention, and who's not. (i have absolutely no room to be going on
about poorly written anything.)<br />
<br />
i'm shocked at how consistently out of step i apparently am on this
question. most women say 'creepy.' wtf? perhaps, if you're the
desired individual, but that's not what the question is implying.
have none of you ever been in the situation where you wanted
someone who didn't want you in return? falls under the 'unrequited'
umbrella in my book. sometimes you love them and sometimes it's
just desire. so... what's 'creepy' about that?<br />
<br />
then we have, 'foolish.' i'm sorry but for one to be labeled as
'foolish,' the implication is, through your actions, you have
delivered these consequences, leaving nothing but this
hopeless/unrequited love. i do not limit the endless possibility's
to arrive at that dead end, principality driven by ones own
foolishness. sloppy thinking. i'd allow for foolish if the question
was 'what do you think about dwelling in...' remember, we're
answering the question asked.<br />
<br />
if there's a switch somewhere that turns on and off love, and i
have control of that switch, i'd be forever in your debt if you
could point it out to me.<br />
<br />
to be in love and not have that love returned is a shitty feeling
and a shitty space to be in. but i'll bet you kraft dinner this has
happened to most of us a time or two.<br />
it does however, demonstrate the capacity for love. and given the
three poor choices above, i'd choose as 'romantic.'</em><br />

_______________<br />
<br />
well, it seems that after 13 years i am back to single life. my
long term, albeit somewhat open relationship status has
changed.<br />
<br />
me: i consider myself a <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=creative"">creative</a>; an <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=artist"">artist</a>, yet someone who uses both lobes.
originally from the midwest i moved here 25 years ago and found my
home and people. i worked in animation and modeling for many years
but i prefer my art tangible. i make sculpture, big sculpture,
mostly metal these days. i tend to think about food in terms of
color. i like the way sounds look and feel. i enjoy life and value
spontaneity. i am gregarious, tangential, silly, analytical, and
inspiring. a burner (burningman) since the man last stood on the
ground ('95). i value creativity and inspiration, music and
science, sensuality and fun. i am an entp and according to
mindtime's phenomenological approach to thought, a future thinker
rather than a past or present thinker.","constantly re-inventing. creating art; big art; mostly metal,
sometimes wood, stone or other things. i made my own boulders when
i landscaped my yard because i wanted specific rocks. i raise
kittens to think that life is a playground; something i personally
think adults should be raised to believe as well. i tend to turn
out streetlights as i walk by when i am inspired and i am
continuously wondering why. i have been planning a trip to bali.
and even then i am wondering about the next destination. i am
fascinated about extremely alternative uses of electricity. i am
hanging out with my wide and varied family of friends doing
outrageous things in the name of spontaneity and art. for instance,
here is a typical houseboat trip where we decided to have fun
making a music video. will you even read more if you watch
it?<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfc_5xyvv6i","inspiring people. making creative juices flow. wearing colorful
clothes. not many guys stray from drab. that's not me. touch; i
have been told i explore the body as if it is a work of art. well,
what else would you expect from a sculptor.","bright blue smiley happy eyes.","sci-fi movies, thriller books, electronic dance music, food of all
kinds but partial to thai, sushi and taco truck tacos.","kisses, laughter, love, social connections, an internet connection,
snuggling, hope, music, power tools, my costume box. that was 10
but hey, i am an overachiever.","the future, possibilities, what if's.","out being social.","there is always more to learn about life and ones self. for
instance. if i place a vibrator to the bridge of my nose will i
sneeze nonstop until it is removed. and unfortunately, yes, there
is video evidence of this on line. you will have to ask if you want
to see that link.","the aforementioned music video <strong>didn't</strong> scare
you...<br />
the music video <strong>did</strong> scare you...<br />
you just want to express your opinion of this other wacky music
video:<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-jn3vh26nq<br />
(i recently met the folks who did it).<br />
<br />
you should message me if you know all the colors and flavors of
quarks.<br />
you think bubble chambers can be used to create art.<br />
when you hear the words, mission control, you go beyond associating
""aerospace vehicle flight management"".<br />
you think bicycle day should be a worldwide recognized
holiday.<br />
<br />
perhaps you should just message me if we have high friend and or
match percentages, want friendship or casual fun. or want to do
something creative. or you have an enemy factor of absolute zero. i
am kinda curious about that as it happens as infrequently as a 99%
match.<br />
<br />
lastly, i do seem to have a type for my physical interest.
definitely contact me if you are petite, between 5' and 5'5"",
devious smile with a high iq. and if you viewed my previous profile
i am now somewhat wary of the extremes within open relationships. i
enjoy playful fun <strong>""with""</strong> my partner. i view my
partner as number one.<br />
<br />
so... if we share similar aspects you should give some thought to
the possibilities of a new friendship.","white",68,-1,"artistic / musical / writer","2012-06-29-19-07","oakland, california","doesn&rsquo;t want kids","straight","has dogs and has cats","","m","aquarius and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","no","english (fluently), other (okay)","single"

these things always seem to put so much pressure on really
narrowing yourself down to a particular way. it really makes you
think about how you view yourself &amp; how you want others to view
you. you cross your fingers &amp; hope that they are the same. i
feel like i am a very easy going person, but that doesn't mean i
don't know what i want. i think reading in bed is sexy, so is
humility &amp; a charming awkwardness. i like to think that i am a
very deep person who thinks a lot about a lot of things. i love
people, &amp; learning any kind of new skill. i read all the time.

enjoying the outdoors - running and hiking in the hills with my

without the romance and willing to accept my limited availability

find it weird to say i'm 'interested in everyone'- i don't roll
like that, homie- so i'm not switching that option. but really, a
few of you should wanna hang.","workin' for the weekend. i'm interested in community service and
the intricacies of the nom-profit adventure. preventive health

captures something special. getting along with animals and
children. i can eat good cheese really well and pick a wine people

what the decision making process of one's destiny's all about...
huh... yea. ok... uh, sorry- spaced out there for a minute.","that i'm mostly goofy but compared to most pretty serious; i gotta

would seem to suggest.","girl with a dragon tattoo books were fun and the time travelers'
wife is a nice exploration of romance and (interdimensional)
personal conflict; jiddu krishnamurti, keith dowman's articles on
vajrayana stuff, an act of state about dr. king and ghandi by
ghandi. books 'on tape'. mostly i read a lot of long-form
journalism but i'm taking a break from the news sites as much as i
can during the current election cycle. i figure i have everything
to lose and little to gain from becoming super cynical and jaded by
all the asinine coverage coming down the pike.<br />

i listen to this american life, radio lab, marketplace and fresh
air on npr and read about man's mess and wonder.<br />
<br />
i have a man-crush on richard dolan's mind. it's pretty much over
the top.<br />
<br />
in addition to aforementioned iconoclasts, i also identify with
bill hicks. i see his work as inspiring, compassionate and (above
all) realistic. his shtick makes me feel understood. check out the
documentary, 'american', by his family and friends and if you can
appreciate how easy it is to enjoy then you can understand the kind
of person i am and, perhaps, my gallows' humor of wonderment,
disappointment and bedazzled faith in humanity: that we'll keep
puttin' in work- being so very interesting.<br />
<br />
i listen to jazz, blues, pandora radio stations: neil young-
harvest, neko case- blacklisted, miles davis- kind of blue and
stevie wonder (yea!) and howlin' wolf... i like lt3- luke thomas'
trio. there's more, but really- c' mon. i figure it's best not to
get carried away. i'm not here to make lists, just friends- good
friends, i think. [ok fine- andrew bird and israel kaanoi
kamakawiwoole.]<br />
<br />
the town about bank robbers and good will hunting about a boy
genius are favorites and i saw the fighter and liked it. i enjoy
deep moral-of-the-story cinema and action like the latest batman
movies, goofball like trading places. i liked punch drunk love,
hearts in atlantis and thunderheart most of all. meet joe black was
quite interesting- i enjoyed the metaphysical conceit and the
performances. ummm... even though i've seen them so many times it's
hard to count, i may still be able to watch shawshank, the green
mile or dances with wolves again. we'll just have to wait and see.
i enjoy any movie that's got one or two of a few dozen
actors/essess in it and i watch all kinds of documentaries on the
netflix site.<br />
<br />
i also like and eat food- especially thai, indian, or russian
roots-style and the like. i meat eat but would like to phase more
to the other side... i'm having a hard time, recently, reconciling
my salivation response and appetite with my love of all teh cute,
beautiful animals in the world- and the environment and stuff.
generally, i steer towards things i can both identify and, if
pressed, easily describe without suspecting that continuous
consumption would make 7 in 10 people sick. the way i heard it,
you've only got one body so treating it well seems best.","*mila the (lone) cat. just like many other people who have pets i
think mine has special qualities and feel fortunate to be her

look all merle haggard. while staying up all night has a lot going

ignore this too often.<br />

necessarily, but honesty and sincerity are important to me; i don't
subscribe to or appreciate the overblown so-called irony espoused
by self absorbed types masquerading as 'too-cool-to-care'
nihilists. blech. i really appreciate people who actually give a
shit, especially if it's about something to do with the greater
good or at least not just limited to serving their own self
interest. (but hey, too short's got a point- you gotta get in where
you fit in- so i understand if you're really focused on getting
paid or educated or whatever. more power to ya.)","being all that i can be- in the sense of being a good friend,

as in 'surgical intervention', not cosmetic.<br />

that's your kind of thing; i understand some people can't
understand why i'm here to make friends but if making friends is
one of the reasons you're here then that's gotta stand for
something. i don't like to get on a lot of social networking sites
so this one will have to do the trick for now.<br />
<br />
i enjoy hiking mt. tamalpias and a few regional parks in marin and
sonoma counties, playing pool up in petaluma (or at any decent bar
with a table, really) or going on a photo journey. loud, crowded
places aren't my cup o' tea- unless lt3 starts playing beckett's
pub again- i can take an hour or so of a buzzing place but after a
while the nerves get frazzled. this means i will never go dancing
with you and your fabulous, fun friends no matter how much you all
enjoy yourselves.<br />
<br />
since (it turns out, according to the profile-mill) people have
really bad ideas about communicating their needs over the internet
and have confused 'casual sex' with 'activity partners', i've taken
the 'activity partners' check off that box even though i'm keen to
enjoy the company of people who are like-minded. don't let said
absence stop you from saying hi. really, i mean it.<br />
<br />
message me if you understand why a fake mustache or a common
infatuation with disgusting beer might not actually be a reliable
source of pride. additionally, i think a circle of friends that
doesn't act like a hall of mirrors sounds good and that loving
others' differences makes way for genuine respect.<br />
<br />
any bright ideas? off-the-wall adventures? i've got genuine picnic
street cred. what's that, you ask? more badass than you can
possibly believe, that's what that means. basically, i'm game.

working in a startup (bay area), and working in a multinational

occasionally they even call to ask for advice (!). i admit that my
one-on-one basketball games with each of them changed character
dramatically when they grew from, say, 5-8, to 6-4 (where all three
ended up). it is a serious problem to give away 3 inches in height

but i'll write more because this is about me and not audrey
hepburn. i was born in la, went to college in santa cruz, and have
lived in the city for six years now and it's the longest i've ever
lived anywhere. i work in a tall skyscraper editing online news by
day, which tends to drive me to more creative pursuits in my off
hours. i'm a comedy&nbsp;and music nerd, and my favorite festivals
right now are the pickathon and the sf sketch fest. the only thing
that i've had a fanatical obsession with is twin peaks. i have
actually been to the great northern, met the one-armed man, and
eaten the cherry pie.<br />
<br />
a recent obsession: getting juiced. as in, taking advantage of my
housemate's newly acquired juicer to get what she has dubbed a ""hot
beet injection."" before that, i was drinking way too much fancy
coffee from sightglass and bluebottle and became a nervous wreck
throughout the morning...i save that for the weekend now when i
wanna get real crazy.<br />

to serial monogamy, but, since i'm not going anywhere in the

no joe shmoe. so, i paint murals. where do you need a mural? your

to write and that's the first sentence i came up with - this being

the camaraderie, the teamwork and the activity all rolled into one
that i love. i even like going to sporting events like football and

never breaking a dish or loosing your keys in the lake again. if
the olympics don't work out for me, i'm also really good at
'reading water'. i've spent a lot of time on rivers so have learned
this ridiculous ability to tell where/how/when/why water is moving
the way it is. so, if i don't catch whatever you just dropped in
the river, i might be able to tell you where it's going. those are
some of my 'really good' talents - on other fronts i may not be
really good - in fact i may be really bad. but, if i'm interested
i'll try real hard regardless.","i'm pretty short so people usually notice that about me first.

with a woman for almost 6 years until a year ago and i met her
about a year after being married for 10 years. any kind of person
might be the right one for me. who knows? i am more mature now, but
was a bit of a peter pan. worked as a lawyer for years, before
joining the peace corps, working for the courts and going back to
working at law firms. i then practiced in my own small firm, and
tried to make time for my kids, now 18 and 15, before they grew up,
but have melded back into firm life. i have my son at my house 1/2
time, but the rest of the week i am free to be wherever and have
fun and adult conversation. i like a lot of things but they are not
all essential: music, movies, dancing (swing, rock, zydeco...),
hikes in the hills or woods. i care deeply about politics and the
world, although there is much to be cynical about these days and it
is hard to listen to the news. i'm more of a ""night"" person. i can
sometime be watching charlie rose after midnight. but i don't mind
an early person. it's hard to say who would be a match - a very
unlikely person could have a matching heart.","i work for a living but don't live for work........ i'm pretty into
staying fit by getting out to hear live music and getting up to
enjoy it - it gives me energy even when tired from the week.
playing guitar and painting a bit. i usually keep up on the world
and culture with the new york review, economist or new yorker, but
i'm not sure that is as essential to who i am now... i'm aware that
there are more lasting truths, both in terms of the ultimate
meaning of existence and in being in the moment, with someone or by
myself. i'm usually planning some project (real estate, whatever)
but i'm glad to be distracted by the here and now....","listening, getting into your story and what you enjoy. (if you
would be the same way, we might spend a lot of time figuring out

thousand clowns or the tyrone power version of the razor's edge,
casablanca, seventh seal, wild strawberries, a cary grant/kate

many are cosmic, life-changing or enlightening about hidden truths
of existence. maybe dangerous beauty.... actually ""up"" and toy
story 3 came close to a deep emotional description of a parent's
nostalgia as a child leaves home or the beauty of a lifelong
relationship, very adult themes that i got to witness because my
kid was then young enough to want to go to animated films (no
longer)...can't think of many others that really matter. comedies
like 40 year old virgin, hangover, knocked up are at least funny
(most aren't). i used to listen to the grateful dead, neil young,
cs&amp;n, van, allman bros., chicago blues. still have about 300
vinyl albums but rarely pull them out these days - mostly listen to
npr and kcsm. now, i'm more into swing music (count basie, stephan
grapelli, sinatra, ella, louis, steve lucky, lavay) or kcsm-type
jazz (it's fairly tame jazz but not totally easy listening....) i
will sometimes be found listening to classical. if it's new age, it
has to go somewhere with a lyric or a melody, unless you're
floating in a pool or it's me strumming my own guitar and trying
those aimless modal chord combinations; but i'd like to be turned

active and adore being outside doing pretty much anything. one
thing i would love to learn how to do, is surf. i own my own dog
walking/pet sitting business, which certainly appeals to my desire
for the outdoors. i'm not the kind of girl who allows her fears to
overcome her, i'm more of a ""i'll prove i can conquer this"" kind of
person. i have a total sassy side and like to joke around a lot and
i have yet to see a ""horror"" movie that truly scares me and
challenge anyone to try and change that. humor is such a huge thing
to me and i love to laugh!<br />
<br />
i'm looking for someone to complement who i am as an individual

would be someone who loves to be active and do things outdoors and
travel. a dude who has a solid job and a funny, easy going
personality is a must have as well.","right now i'm working on getting my business off the ground. i'm

music can compliment any mood that you're in. a few old school

either 80's cardio, rock hits, or hard rock strength.<br />
<br />

moving to san francisco on august 1st, 2012. presently i live in
mountain view, so it is not much of a hike to meet new folks in
""the city"" as it stands already. standard profile
begins...now:<br />
<br />
i am a hopeless romantic. i really try to believe the best in
everyone, and i hope for the best in myself. i regularly tell
people i am the luckiest person i know.<br />
<br />
i use 1980's phrases like ""keen"", ""rad"" and ""badass"", and i am told
i have a rather peculiar vernacular. i really enjoy talking...in
fact if i am nervous i talk even more. i really love useless, but
interesting trivia.<br />
<br />
i adore traveling and taking risks as much as possible. i enjoy the
rush i get by being pulled out of my comfort zones as well. my
favorite places i have visited are paris, dubrovnik, sicily and
hong kong. i have lived in richmond, va, baltimore, md, right
outside of dc (gaithersburg), and now silicon valley.<br />
<br />
i am actually an introvert, but being in high-end sales and
acquisitions for years, i have learned how to carry on engaging
conversations with practically anyone, so most people actually
think i am super extroverted.<br />
<br />
sarcasm is a critical part of my life, and i greatly value wit and
cleverness. i enjoy ""creative swearing""... anyone can say ""shit"",
but ""misanthropic fuck-tard"" is a lot more amusing, and most likely
more appropriate.<br />
<br />
i am fascinated by robots, museums and multi-hour conversations. my
favorite video games are galaga and mario kart 64. i love
roller-coasters and people who smile all of the time. i can be very
easily convinced to go see or do something just because it's weird
or new. i have dark auburn hair, am left handed, and i am an only
child. i have been in the bay area for about 6 months and on the
rare occasion i have a drink at a bar, it is typically a double
shot of well tequila on the rocks, no lime or salt. i am very
easily distracted by shiny objects, and i think i am totally
awesome-sauce.","i have moved out to the bay area from richmond, va...where i still
remotely operate that state's comicon (nerdy!). i am still doing
some publishing work in comics.<br />
<br />
summer 2012 update: just finished publsihing a tmnt comic, and i am
working on some robert crumb recipe cards to debut at the san diego
comic-con in july. i will be moving from mountain view to san
francisco on august 1st, 2012.<br />
<br />
since moving to the bay are in summer of 2011, i have worked hard
to lose weight...i got over 200 lbs (holy poop!) 2 years ago, but
now i am back in the 170s. i really like taking walks, especially
with my mutt, who has adorable heterochromia iridium (which, i am
told, is a very groovy mutation).<br />
<br />
previous gigs include television and radio voice-over work, graphic
design, being a multi-spoken-language database admin, director of a
failed dot-com (had to testify in front of senate for that one),
being the #1 seller of comic books in the world on ebay, and acting
as a primary vintage jewelry buyer for the highest rated jewerly
store in central virginia. seriously.","building intricate stuff with a finite amount of steps.
think...ikea furniture or legos. i believe i am fairly good at
seeing the ""big picture"" of intricate tasks. i have the highest
honors in the field of comic books, which is really important (to
about 5 people living in their mothers' basements). saying ""that's
what she said"", and being the only one laughing.","i have a very unique timbre to my voice. it is not unsettling, but
even at normal volumes it has a way of slicing through ambient
sounds. if i am in a room with 20 people, and carrying on a
conversation with someone, almost everyone can hear and distinguish
my voice distinctly without me having to raise my voice at all. it
is a peculiar gift.","favorite movies: star wars (ep iv-vi), fight club, shawshank
redemption, back to the future i-iii, army of darkness, x-men 2,
the usual suspects, indiana jones, goonies, ghostbusters, kingpin,
eurotrip and up.<br />
<br />
favorite music: whatever pandora throws at me...stations include:
save ferris, pink floyd, moe., bollywood, explosions in the sky,
adele, rush, slough feg, john williams and johnny cash.<br />
<br />
tv shows: afv, mxc, snl, st: voyager, the league, it's always
sunny, firefly, eastbound. i don't have cable, and have to hook my
computer up to an old projector to watch any tv, so i usually only
get about an hour of television in a week, typically downloaded and
zero ads. hated ads ever since i won a tivo in an essay contest
back in 2000.","1) bay area burritos<br />

remind me of how peculiar california can really be.<br />

my idea of a great date is a 6 hour conversation with zero
pretense, comfy shoes and possibly skee-ball or mini-golf. i'm not
really a ""club-hopping"" person, but honestly don't mind if you are.

yard, being with friends, spending time with my 13-year-old niece.
i watch very little tv - only a news show and possibly charlie
rose, depending on who is appearing. i like travelling to a warm
climate once a year (i've gone to puerto vallarta the last three
years) and car camping. i would like to try kayaking. i'm
considering getting a keyboard and playing piano again.<br />
<br />
i like bluegrass, rock, folk, some country music.<br />
<br />
i believe we need to keep obama in office so he can bring us closer
to equality in our country.<br />
<br />
i am looking forward to doing fun things with you.","","being a good friend and companion<br />

came away with an understanding of global warming that i would not
have had otherwise.<br />

any way but i love ordinary; it gets such a bad rap in my opinion.
my life's really simple, and honestly not that interesting; it
doesn't take much to make me happy.<br />
<br />
<strong>i'm a designer.</strong><br />
it basically means that i give a lot of thought and care to
<em>what</em> things are, <em>why</em> they are, <em>how</em> they
look, and the relationships between all those. it also means i'm a
very visual person.<br />
<br />
<strong>i love movies.</strong><br />
i love everything about film. i still love the experience of going
to and watching in a old theatre. i hate that liking old films or
foreign films is interpreted as snobby. i feel like there's so many
great movies i haven't seen yet, so i'm really into older stuff,
but i'm also down for new releases too.<br />
<br />
<strong>i love traveling.</strong><br />
i try to get out of the u.s. as often as possible. i enjoy breaking
my daily routine and being out of my element, it forces you think
think about everything taken for granted. in may 2010, i spent my
month-long sabbatical all over japan. i've also been to thailand,
vietnam, scotland, and briefly to various spots around
europe.<br />
<br />
<strong>i want to be healthy.</strong><br />
more and more it seems like the most important thing. since hitting
a milestone birthday, i've tried to change my lifestyle and behave
more health consciously:<br />
- actually eating breakfast (still having a hard time with this
one)<br />
- eating more veggies and less meat (love my pork)<br />
- running (not nearly as much as i should)<br />
- getting to bed earlier (love my sleep)","trying to do the right thing.<br />
trying to do no harm.","observing. you can learn a lot if you pay attention.<br />
cleaning. i always try to leave things better than i found
them.<br />
organizing. anything and everything.","maybe that i don't look my age. wait a minute, people wouldn't
notice that until after i've told them. hmmm, i've been told that i
look too serious. i guess that's my natural facial expression. it's

i love murakami. i really need to branch out though. i've read
other authors of course...mostly classics. i'd like to read
more.<br />
<br />
<strong>movies:</strong><br />
i love all kinds, but especially stuff from the 50's and 60's. pta,
aronofsky, coppolas, fellini, fincher, godard, hitchcock, kubrick,
kurosawa, malick, nolan, ozu, truffaut, wkw.<br />
<br />
<strong>music:</strong><br />
as long as it was made with true feeling, genre doesn't matter to
me: classical, electronic, hip-hop, jazz, pop, rock. i love mixing
+ variety: bach, beach boys, beasties, beatles, beethoven, black
keys, ray charles, chopin, nat king cole, coltrane, cream,
d'angelo, miles davis, debussy, de la, delerue, doors, bob dylan,
bill evans, stan getz, al green, erroll garner, gorillaz, kings of
leon, kinks, liszt, delico, lovin' spoonful, massive attack,
mozart, phoenix, pixies, police, prince, queen, radiohead, otis
redding, prt, peppers, schubert, stones, spoon, strokes, talking
heads, three dog night, tribe, turtles, wilco. i'd like to start
going to more shows.<br />
<br />
<strong>food:</strong><br />
i'm not a hard-core foodie, but i definitely appreciate a good
meal. i don't think good food has to be expensive, or from a fancy
restaurant. i eat all kinds but i tend to like asian cuisines:
chinese, japanese, thai, vietnamese. i enjoy trying new foods and
discovering good restaurants.","- <a class=""plink"" href=

my 'version' of poly in practice is more closely aligned with

i am involved in a relationship/deep friendship but i have taken
the liberty to list myself as single because listing myself as the
former seems to severely limit okc interactions and i am in many

committed to the process of getting to know each other. i'm
definitely open to ages and races but sex -- men only please :)
people seem to want to just rush into things and pow have
everything be like a fireworks display and then i think they tend
to fizzle out just as fast. so...i'm just open to friendship right
now...<br />
<br />
previous: i guess i'm just not in the mood of talking myself up and
would rather just get to know someone and listen to them talk about
themselves and let them get to know me in a way that has a more
natural flow ;-) this doesn't mean i can't hold a conversation it
just means that sometimes i wish i could wave a magic wand and have
my soulmate here beside me. i'm saying this somewhat facetiously
because i really don't think i believe in the idea of a soulmate.
even if i was with a person for 30 years and they (god forbid)
passed away, i would still want to believe that there was another
love out there for me. yes, that is thinking a bit too far in the
future but i'm working on trying to live more in the moment
lol.<br />
i would like to meet someone that is open-minded without being
super liberal and crazy. the current definition of open-minded is
sort of a free-for-all and i don't view it that way. i would say
i'm more of a moderately conservative person in some ways but i
definitely have my wild and spontaneous side. i'm a bay area native
currently living in the east bay but originally from the city. i'm
in the technical field (who isn't!) but am currently considering a
return to school for a masters degree and a career change.<br />
i have two teenage sons and i love them dearly but once they're
grown and gone it's gonna be all about me! lol they don't need a
dad but someone that is teen-friendly would be a welcome addition
to my life.<br />
anyway back to the soulmate thing. sometimes you just meet someone
and everything is so easy and just falls into place effortlessly.
the problem with that is sometimes it's so easy you forget to view
the red flags and warning signs. i would like to meet someone and
keep my eyes open but still have the pieces fit together like that.
i'm not a person that really has favorites. there are a few
categories of things (movies for example) where i do have some
favorites but overall i might have a consuming interest in
something one year and the next year i'll be on to something else.
i definitely don't have a favorite song or color or day of the week
or anything like that. this makes me more flexible to be
open-minded as to my partner's interests but i have enough things
that interest me and enough life-long friends that i won't try to
lose myself in the other person's life but still have my own
interests as well. i wouldn't want to be with someone that requires
so much ""alone"" time though that we don't have enough time
together. okay that was rambling but i hope i've said a little
about myself at least to give you an idea of, if not who i am,
then, who i would like to be with lol<br />

books: most sci-fi although fantasy not-so-much. stephen king. i
will read non-fiction (e.g. self-help) occasionally. urban
fiction.<br />
<br />
movies: everything with the exception of that goofy/slapstick type
comedy and no extreme horror.<br />
<br />
music: i like music. i like going to see live music. i like dancing
sometimes. i don't love music like i have to hear it daily or it
has to be on whenever i'm in the car and i don't really have too
many favorite artists or bands. i guess i like mostly neo-soul,
old-school r &amp; b, gospel, christian, and ""other"" as far as
genres i listen to most often. by ""other"" i mean that i like random
songs from probably almost every genre of music except death metal
or something like that.<br />
<br />
food: i'm adventurous when it comes to food although i really have
never liked most morrocan or indian foods and i rarely, if ever,

much of a fan of top 40 stuff or country. i love electronic music.
most notably artists such as, glitch mob, bassnectar, adam

a new woman has joined the dating scene, classy, world traveler
with flair. slender, green eyes, loads of dark hair and a smile
that lights up a room. she is described by friends as smart,
creative, gracious, youthful, occasionally goofy- but her children
will not divulge the details...and ""a great friend to have"".
marketing professional, photographer, poet, loves to cook, used to
hit a decent tennis ball... equally at home in the country or
city.<br />
<br />
if you are loved by your family, respected by your peers,
financially stable, and feel giving back to the world in some
fashion matters- then you just might want to meet this woman.","while i working in the field of marketing....living a balanced life
is what matters most to me. family, friends, the arts, food, wine,
travel, gardening, volunteering, writing poetry working out and
maybe learning golf....sign me up!","","hmmmm.......either my smile or maybe the hair?","cuisine...the list would be long, french, italian, fusion, indian,
local fresh inventive fare with great wine- even better: movies-
enjoy many, independent, thought-provoking, chick flicks: skip
horror and the plotless, r&amp;b, classical of most sorts, choral,
rock of sorts, opera- not into easy listening, jazz or rap. books-
novels, history, cognitive thinking, pondering the great truths,
art......back to food...","love, my children, friends, coffee, great food, flowers...","if we ever meet- this might be an interesting topic over coffee, a
glass of wine or dinner.","","i don't know you.","you like what you have read and are looking for a serious long
term, committed relationship, are well-educated|smart and financial
stable. i would consider relocating eventually for the right person

independent, successful. i set some pretty high goals for myself
befor age 30 and i'm proud to say i've achieved them : )<br />
unfortunately while doing so i totally put relationships/meeting
new people on the back burner so here i am. i will finish later...","my career &amp; personal responsibilities keep me pretty busy. i'm
a very responsible person and a hard worker. i'm content &amp;
confident in who &amp; where i am in life. i always make time to do
things i enjoy, depending on level of importantance. my work shifts
are always 12 hours, and i also go to the gym for about a hour
either before or after work. once all my buisnessnis handled i like
to relax, but i can never stay relaxed too long. i like to take
advantage of my free time &amp; the beautiful bay area, what ever i
do i like to do i do right.. i figure i work hard, i'm entitled to
play just as hard too!!","the important things!<br />
i take the most pride in being a amaging mother to my junior. she's
involved in several activities, doing great academically, perfict
attendance in school. second, which is just as important, i'm a
excellent provider for myself &amp; my family. i'm a natural
leader. i'm confident in the decisions i make &amp; i know i have
what it takes to lead my team to victory! every time!!!","idk, my dimple?","","1. god! without him i would be lost<br />
2. my junior. defiantly my motivation to be the best woman i can
possibly be.<br />
3. my family. were very close. i talk to or see my mom,
grandmother, aunt &amp; cousin daily. i have a wonder full support
system &amp; lots of love.<br />
4. money. life would be pretty boring with out it.<br />
5. music. to me it usually makes everything better.. &amp; dancing
is good exercise<br />
6. sadly my cell phone","vacations. i want to see more of the world! i take 1 big vacation
each year. october 2010 i stayed a week in hawaii, may 2011 i
stayed a week in florida. i'm plannin my next big 1 june 2012 for
my 30th birthday.<br />
<br />
i don't have any friends who are in position to be able to vacation
with me so when i travel i take my junior with me &amp; we
go!<br />
<br />
ideally each year i would like to take 1 family vacation (including
my child) and 1 adult vacation where i can go and be myself for a
week and unwind.","i work 2 weekends a month. on my weekends off i do what ever sounds
good to me that day. i never go to the bar, club or lounge. i'm not
totally opposed to any of those places there just not places i
prefer to be. sometimes i just get in my car and go!","i'm a stunning woman, beautiful inside &amp; out, i have a great
career, etc., most ppl would say i'm the total package but i have
to resort to this to attempt to find a quality man.","you already have a job/career &amp; know where your going in life.
that's the first this i look at is ""what your doing w/ your life"" i
skip right past ""about me"" because i want someone who's where i'm
at not someone who's still unsure. im serious about my time and my
responsibilities. i work hard &amp; im looking for a partner who is
too. if you party too often and like the club scenes, your probably
not for me. i do like to drink, but i do not abuse it. i do not
like smoking at all.<br />
<br />
one last thing, my time is extremely important to me. the person i
involve myself with will have to respect my time, if your more
careless with yours were not going to be comparable. definate deal
beaker.<br />
<br />
im looking or a man to build a friendship with and hopefully turn
in to something serious/long term. i want to go on movie, dinner,
coffee, breakfast and/or lunch dates, different events in the area,
try new activities, etc. i want to find someone i enjoy being
around and i want to see all the time &amp; vise versa.<br />

i'm a scientist, and i've taken a new job that has me situated in
the lower 48, new to the bay area (and online dating). much of my
job is running around in a little boat mapping the seafloor,
creating nautical charts. i respond to whatever ruffles up the
water or lurks underneath threatening safe navigation, too. i
really like water, and am thankful to live near it, work on it, and
play over / under, inside out of it.<br />
<br />
i didn't take the usual route in life. i'm a journeyman. i've been
a bunch of places, enjoyed a few adventures; been there and back
again. i am proud that i'm not a wishy-washy guy that talks about
what he would like to do, what could be, what's over the
rainbow.<br />
<br />
nope. i get it done. i am.<br />
<br />
i've paid my dues, worked my way through school for a computer
science degree, and then topped it off with some graduate work in
remote sensing. after college i promptly toughed it up in alaska
for ten years working in the field, three of which living off the
grid in a floating cabin, and another four serving aboard a 321
foot ship conducting hydrographic survey.<br />
<br />
i ended up a working professional, responsible for expensive things
and trusted with the safety of others.<br />
<br />
my friends tell me to mention that i can ride a unicycle and juggle
at the same time. they say girls dig that, but my circustry is a
deeply personal thing -- like maybe something i might do on the
fourth date.<br />
<br />
lastly, i grew up with artist parents who encouraged creativity. to
this day i appreciate the simple joy of making things. i draw a lot
-- mostly cartoons. i've drawn hundreds of them, most published in
odd rural alaskan papers or scientific journals. i make music, too,
but not very well. basically i understand creativity is a big part
of life, and frivolous, joyful expression is just as important as
all the serious scientific mumbo jumbo i surround myself with
daily.<br />

<br />
i grew up on the east coast, and came out to berkeley for grad

bay area and have decided to stay for good. i decided that the
combination of weather, people, and nature was worth far more than

i am in a great place in my life. i've been around the block a
couple times, learned some lessons- some easily but many the hard
way- which i value immensely, and now am ready to apply them. i am
ready to move forward in my life, partnered with a best friend and
lover, and focus on building something together.<br />
<br />
i am hoping to find that certain someone that can make any event or

charming as the smile they share with the world. out-going,
athletic and spontaneous, while at the same time relaxed and
leisurely, intelligent, sincere and possessing the virtues that

things; i love an independent thinker with a vivid imagination.
kindness, honesty, integrity, loyalty, and tenderness are tattooed
on your soul! unwavering curiosity, beaucoup passion, combustible
chemistry, seemingly telepathic, incessant, time-defying
communication, and cheek-hurting laughter are always nice, too. the
frosting would be to meet a man who can also negotiate a rickshaw
ride across town for 20 rupees or less. perhaps most importantly,
you want a relationship in which we'd share interests, challenge
yet support each other, and expand each other's frontiers. a long
shelf life is desirable. other than that, surprise me! i love to
have expectations shattered now and then.","is interesting, challenging, rewarding, and hopefully leaving the

<br />
i will do my best here to offer you a snapshot, or perhaps even a
zoom-in view of myself and my world. i do this knowing that there
is no substitute for what happens in real life - you know, like
when two people are close enough to actually sense each
other.<br />
i do know that engaging in live, two-way conversation feels much
more real to me than describing myself to you this way, but here
goes.<br />
<br />
my friends describe me as passionate, playful, expressive, and
adventurous. i'm all about my next adventure and i have a big
appetite for life. i aim for a combination of routine and
spontaneity in my day to day.<br />
i'm fortunate to posses a natural buoyancy toward life. i've
cultivated that by being pretty vigilant about watching my mind and
not necessarily believing the stories it likes to generate. there's
often quite a gap between 'story' and 'reality'. as byron katie
likes to say: ""reality is always kinder than the story we tell
ourselves about it.""<br />
<br />
i get along great with kids because i still have a lot of kid left
inside me, but i have also graduated to full adult-hood. i pay my
bills on time and don't make too many messes in life. (well maybe
some intentional ones, like when i'm finger painting with chocolate
pudding)<br />
if i like something, more is good, if not, there's plenty else to
try.<br />
i love being a girl and all that it entails. whether that means
dressing up for a special event, or having full access to my
emotions, i wouldn't trade it. having a reason to dress up is a big
pleasure, i also like a day in my pj's every now and then.<br />
<br />
i especially enjoy the unique polarity of masculine and feminine,
it's such a rich and unique alchemy. what i'm drawn to in a a man
is his quiet confidence and his depth of presence. someone who's
comfortable enough in himself that he doesn't need to pretend,
posture, or impress, but can simply be the man that he is. secure
enough that when he's feeling something he can share it honestly.
at home in his body and naturally affectionate. extra plus if
you're familiar with tantra and/or taoist practice.<br />
<br />
my vision for my next relationship is one that is very dynamic,
engaged, and a lot of fun. i'm drawn to connecting with those who
are relatively free from the residue of their past so are free to
live, act, and make decisions from today.<br />
we all have shadow, and one of it's favorite places to show itself
is in deeper relationship, but when there is space to welcome that,
and even curiosity about it, i find it moves along pretty
quickly.<br />
<br />
i keep discovering that what matters most, is less about what i'm
getting, than how i'm contributing, and i strive to have a positive
impact whenever i can.<br />
i'm definitely an extrovert since i really enjoy people, i also
need some down time to hang with myself.<br />
<br />
although i love children, i'm probably not looking to have any, but
i sure like playing with them. i wouldn't rule out relationship
with you if you're a dad, so long as you've also got time and space
for another significant relationship in your life.","spending time with my friends.<br />

right?<br />
<br />
a little about me: i live in oakland, i used to live in new
england, i work regular hours but have been known to escape on
short notice, my dog is (seriously) the best dog ever, i enjoy
climbing in the sierra and sometimes indoors, skiing when
conditions warrant the drive (i.e. a lot this past winter), and
otherwise keeping things mostly sane. ""fitness"" seems a ridiculous
pursuit in its own right, yet i enjoy doing things that warrant
being in shape.<br />
<br />
dogs and babies like me. so, if you think you can revert to your
infantile/canine roots, you might like me too.<br />
<br />
though not terribly shy in person, given the medium i'm choosing to
keep (some) things in check. i understand (and certainly
appreciate) the tacit chemistry that has been known to overtake our
immediate and reptilian urges, but what i am seeking is the kind of
long(er)-term coupling that will continue to be interesting, grow
organically, and allow for change. if this makes sense to you,
please nudge me in the ribs when i become aloof without
warning.<br />
<br />
nb: i am terrible at feigning disinterest. you will (or damn well
should) know if i am interested.","this is the farthest west i've lived, and it feels like home. for
much of my 20s i sustained a fairly peripatetic penchant, taking
long road trips to great places that sometimes became home. moving
here, however, was different, for more personal reasons. for about
6 years i had a great job with a notable local outdoor related
business... until it somewhat suddenly closed its doors earlier
this spring. so at this point my work ethic keeps me occupied a)
looking for legitimate indoor, sitting-down work, b) sometimes on a
friend's construction site, at which i get filthy every day and
quite efficiently exhaust myself, and c) otherwise unoccupied. i am
fully aware that this is not the most exciting micro-moment in my
professional life.","all sorts of stuff. and i learn quickly. sometimes a skill or
talent might float from one category to the other.<br />
<br />
but i'm good with children, for some reason (hopefully a good one?)
young mommies tend to hand me their infants to hold; a family
recently asked me if i was interested in being their manny?? edit:
families # 2 and #3 have inquired as to the same.<br />
<br />
i speak dog. which is good, given that i have one.<br />
<br />
i enjoy skiing and if i am not smiling during a ski day, the stars
are certainly out of alignment.<br />

different careers: teaching, acting, touring as a back-up singer or
dancer in well-known bands, corporate it recruiting, performance
artist, managing recording studios, workshop facilitator, repping
art, music teacher, jewelry maker...phew! most recently i got back
into teaching:<br />
i taught music to toddlers &amp; their families for 5 years. two
years ago i taught kindergarten in a high-risk, inner-city
neighborhood. last year i took time off to focus on writing a book
which was incredible.<br />
this year i'm immersed in a whole new line of work and it's quite
an exciting ride. stoked that my spirit likes to try on so many
different ways to be productive on this here little spinning
marble.","improv...i'm in a troupe and we perform often. i love improv as it
lets me make use of my acting skills in a spontaneous,
fly-by-the-seat-of-your pants way. like meditating, it compels me
to be in the moment...i'm also good at creative writing, designing
&amp; creating belly chains, riding horses bareback, swimming with
wild dolphins &amp; humpback whales (though not at the same time!),
making babies....smile (caught ya on that one :), loving up 4
legged canine friends, and dancing to deep, dirty dubstep.<br />
in the past i was quite accomplished at fire dancing and tribal
belly dance...getting pretty good at meditation and digging how
grounded it makes me feel.","...my height (5' 11 1/2"" in bare feet), my insatiable curiosity and
that i smile a lot... next folks usually notice my humor, as i like
to make people laugh. when you've hung around me for a little while

might notice that we've become engaged in some kind of compelling
conversation. (i gotta share this, as it's an ongoing situation: on
a regular basis, a stranger will walk up to me &amp; exclaim, ""wow,
you're really tall!"" i've had different come-backs over the years,
but the one that's workin for me right now is, ""no way! that's

<br />
i am married, and happily so, yet have seen the light of a
polyamory style in the last 6 months. i have come to appreciate
what many in other countries know already - it is fine to have
adventuresome relationships outside of your marriage, and continue
to meet new people. if you are open and honest with your spouse,
then things work out. in my case, both my spouse and i are in the
same mindset and are both pursuing outside new friends. it has
added excitement and energy to our individual lives, and our life
as a couple.<br />
no face photos as i have kids in middle and high school, and some
discretion is required (""dad, my friend said her mom saw your
picture on a dating site, wtf"").<br />
happy to send more pictures after some discussion.<br />
<br />
i summarize what another friend told me 2 months ago when i told
her i was exploring this new approach. she said ""marriage should
not be like a prison. you should not have to stop meeting new and
interesting people and having human connections. the most miserable
people tend to be those that stay monogamous on some moral
grounds"". turns out she has been doing this for 5+ years. i urge
people to open their minds to the concept.","planning how to keep meeting new people and experiencing more in
adventure, fun and pleasure. meeting new people is the main way i
plan to do this.<br />
i have a great job that i love, and two great kids and a great
wife. supporting this takes time and energy, but i still have time
to meet some new people.<br />
we can all learn how to live better, live well, live kinder. i have
learned to view life through the ""life is short"" lens during the
past several years, and want to ensure i have as much enjoyment,
and give as much enjoyment to people i care about.","making people laugh and laughing at myself....making a margarita

my faith is extremely important to me. jesus has taught me many
lessons in my short life. he has been there for me in times of
trouble and he always answers prayer (even if the answer is a no).
i often stumble, but i really try to be a light to the world,
someone jesus can use to his glory in the world. one of my favorite
verses is galatians 6:2 ""bear ye one anothers burdens and so
fulfill the law of christ."" jesus has given me a wonderful church
community and provided me with some really amazing opportunities to
travel and see the world. thank you, jesus.","currently, i'm working toward an aa in dance and an as in computer

love sf and work life balance is mandatory!<br />
so, what am i all about?<br />
clearly, you'll see that i'm a series of contradictions! :-) to
start, quality over quantity! i'm not a serial dater but would
probably enjoy cereal on a date;-) i like a little bit of this, but
a little bit of that too! i'm sassy (but still classy) and i like
to spice it up, but i'm nice to everyone from the homeless person
to the quirky waiter to the random person at the coffee shop. can
take it as well as i can dish it! definitely goofy (rarely take
myself too serious) and find the ""funny"" in most situations, but
it's fun to ""geek out"" and have an analytical side too. sort of a
""glam girl-sporty spice"", if you have to label it! (50/50 split but
even that fluctuates with the market) so, i don't mind getting my
hands dirty and love a challenge, but spiders scare me and it would
take more than the sf hills to ditch my heels. unless, i'm running
around cali style, at the beach, on the soccer field or in the
mountains! absolutely a chameleon... which means that i turn colors
to adapt to the environment (change outfits like a superhero).
really, i just truly enjoy the variety of life from one extreme to
the next. can you relate? hopefully not the girly tomboy part, but
being a fellow chameleon with many colors.","by day, working in marketing (which i love). maximizing all sf has
to offer, which feels like adult disneyland right now. taking on a
project of renovating my place. traveling quite a bit:-) making the
most of the rest of my time staying active (snowboarding, cycling,
running, soccer, surfing).","being goofy! mixing it up. being spontaneous. finding common ground
with many different people. staying positive, taking it as well as
i dish it out and finding the ""funny"" in most situations. making
the unexpected happen especially when someone says it can't be
done. traveling! can pack it all into one carry-on and go...","my hair, always laughing and i kind of have a big laugh.","to start... books: malcolm gladwell books (outliers, tipping

(hangover, bridesmaids, stepbrothers, wedding crashers)<br />
- food: sushi, dark chocolate, peanut butter, indian, thai, but
really love discovering a new restaurant or chef, i'll try anything

after spending 4 marvelous years in ireland. i wasn't ready to
leave europe, but san francisco and all it has to offer has been my
savior!<br />
<br />
i grew up in southern california, headed to the midwest for college
where i studied engineering and played big 10 volleyball, and moved
back to california, this time san diego, for graduate school. i've
been with the same company nearly 10 years: 4 in southern ca, 4 in
ireland, and now 1+ year in the bay area.<br />
<br />
i think my friends would describe me as funny/witty with a few
quirks, selfless, smart, and determined. i'm fairly low
maintenance. i like roughing it but crave an occasional luxury. i'm
a social person though i've dropped a few notches on the extrovert
scale over the years. i'm comfortable with spending time alone as
long as i've a good read. however, i love being surrounded by
friends, enjoy hosting/entertaining, and usually have some travel
plans in the works.<br />
<br />
i am open minded and always willing to try something new!","when i'm not traveling or working, i'm enjoying where i live!<br />
<br />
personally, i'm reconnecting with friends, making new friends,
learning the art of pilates, taking greek &amp; roman literature
courses, exercising, following us politics, eating out too much
(easy to do in sf), etc.<br />
<br />
professionally, i'm a sr. manager at a medical device company on
the peninsula. the day to day is not so exciting, but they've been
good to me - moving me around within the organization to different
roles and geographies. i frequently think about continuing my
education, whether to support this career or to start down an
alternate path - planning on making some decisions this year.","- being a good friend<br />
- planning, whether it's a dinner party or a 2-week vacation<br />
- researching something i don't know<br />
- surviving large corporate culture<br />
- reading maps<br />
- most things athletic<br />
- laughing at myself","","- i genuinely love reading and can never seem to clear the backlog
of books i want to read. a few favorites include ""woman in white"",
""nobel house"", ""pillars of the earth"", and ""middlesex"".<br />
- my tv and movie watching is sparse. tv consists of news/politics
(cspan, daily show, presidential debates), series box sets (mad
men, breaking bad, game of thrones), an occasional show (downton
abbey so i can talk to my mom about it), and less mainstream sports
(world cup rugby or soccer, olympics). movies in the last year have
been documentaries or mainstream at kabuki (drive, dragon tattoo)
and i was traveling for 2+ weeks when hunger games came out so must
get to that.<br />
- food is amazing! i enjoy the range (cooking at home to take away
to dives to michelin stars), any ethnicity (sushi to ethiopian to
indian to south american to greek to dim sum), and the nostalgic
basics (yummy grilled cheese, bean &amp; cheese burritos).","- beverages: coffee, tea, red wine, belgian beer, occasional fresh
squeezed juice<br />

music is one of the things i'm most passionate about in life, so
rather than spending 3 hours listing the soundtrack for my life,
and then subjecting you to having to scroll all the way past it as
you ignore most of it, i will paint a broad outline for you:<br />
<br />
music moves us in a way that words cannot express, and the more
thoroughly a piece of music can elicit deep emotions beyond
classification, the more highly i value it.<br />
<br />
we all have various musical predispositions depending on our mood,
energy level, life experience, and general disposition. and my
default switch is usually set at ""funky rhythms"". i enjoy
profoundly entrancing melodies from mozart, brahms, rachmaninov,
etc. as well as a wide variety of ethereal, melodic, down-tempo
music, when in the proper space and mood, but i typically just
happen to be in a more head-bobin', toe-tappin', booty-shakin'
mood.<br />

disabled. but there are alternatives. example: after 9-11, our
family sponsored four muslim kids over four school-years in our
mostly whitebread high school near chicago. they came from
indonesia, egypt, and ghana, all shapes and colors -- and all still
call me dad and are facebook friends. this giving exercise changed
all our lives and showed the effect of deep-breath outreach in the
face of prejudice and fear. it took money and, moreso, parenting
time (they were teens, after all!) -- but i wish we had thought of
sponsorship sooner.","... you sense compatibility or complementarity, like to laugh and

so i tend to know what i'm about and i don't mind telling you how
i'm feeling. i like people who are communicative &amp; functional -
i don't want to have to guess what's wrong, i want you to tell me,
and if you're happy i'd like to hear about it. i'm easy to get
along with, probably largely because i'm not very demanding and i
am very forgiving - i'm appreciative of the things that work out
between us and i understand that sometimes things just don't quite
go as planned. so you're late, or you have to cancel something, or
you're grumpy in the mornings - so what? i take everyone with a
grain of salt, and i don't tend to take anything too
seriously.<br />
<br />
i like to see people i care about as often as i can, but whether
that translates to once a month or twice a week is fine. some
people are busy, some aren't - live your life how you want to, and
i'll be happy if we can do so together. i might really love
spending time with you, but i'm not going to hold it against you if
you're working on a 60-hour week. likewise, i don't want you to
freak out if all of a sudden i have a lot of extra work &amp; we
don't see each other as much for a while.<br />

then i should be making ""$100k+"" as well, so what the hell.","i'm in transition, changing career paths from database
administration to data analysis, working on getting better
qualified for consulting &amp; analyst positions. for now, my
lackluster cover letters (or my terrible resume? no one really
knows) have so far kept me cheerfully tuning queries &amp; tables
instead.<br />
<br />
on a personal level, i'm mostly trying to pull it all together -
build a coherent practice, be a better friend to people i care
about (by replying to their messages more often and more promptly,
by being on time more often), be more organized &amp; effective in
my life (keep everything filed &amp; up to date, keep my personal
space more tidy than not). it's a process - i'm always working on
something, some aspect of me that i feel i can improve. i have very
high standards for me, even as i don't expect too much from others,
and sometimes i feel like every time i get everything dealt with,
something else pops up that i never noticed before. maybe it's a
refining process, and i'm dealing with it all sequentially, but i
doubt it - i think i'm just human, &amp; doing my best to do a good
job at living my life.<br />
<br />
for business/career self-improvement, i'm teaching myself to use a
couple of statistical packages &amp; reading textbooks on
business/process optimization theory (bring it on, nerds), and to
help make my inside vision match my outside world, i read
psychology &amp; behavioral economics books (mostly popular/mass
market, actual textbooks less often). i re-read this paragraph and
i think it makes me sound like a dork, but there you go - either
the rest of the profile shows that i'm not, or i just suck at
describing my life. we'll see.","empathy, forgiveness, welding, procrastinating, mountain biking,
copy editing, endurance sports, changing everything from the inside
out, remaining very still for long periods of time, making foods
whose main ingredients are cocoa products, channeling, speaking
with the spirits (am i serious? am i kidding?), loving, kissing,
listening, negotiating, and breathing (you try it - it's not always
so easy).<br />
<br />
i could use some improvement at: separating essential from
inessential (i once got to the airport without a passport because i
was too focused on which wallet it went in), allowing enough time
for contingencies and emergencies (i'm working on it - see above),
keeping in touch with people i like (it's not even ""out of sight,
out of mind"" - i think about them all the time, i just never let
them know; again, working on it), writing concise sentences without
excessive or semi-irrelevant detail (essential ... inessential ...
it's time for the end of this sentence).","an off-beat sense of humor, an overall sense of relaxed composure,
a wry smile, and my excellent dress sense. if by ""excellent"", it is
understood that i mean ""encompassing the well-bred gentleman's
ideals of bespoke suits cut and blended with '50s loungewear and
occasionally clothes from the '70s that are clearly a cruel joke
perpetrated on an unsuspecting and unfashionable public."" why, you
might ask? why on earth do you ever willingly, knowingly, wear
polyester? because you can't wear clothes that even a retired,
color-blind golfer in florida would find embarrassing without
bringing a feeling into the room that maybe more fun should be
being had right now. maybe you have to be there, but it's true -
although you wouldn't find this out for a while after we met, if we
met, because i find the opposite effect to be in force in casual
first encounters: it's just too hard to get past the plaid.<br />
<br />
regardless of what people notice, they often like me for no
apparent reason, pretty much right off the bat (maybe there are
factors neither i nor they are aware of, but it usually seems like
people like me basically just because i'm there - it's almost
weird, except that's just how it is; my current theory is that i
make people feel good about themselves because i'm very
non-judgmental and because i see the good parts first, and the bad
parts often only much later; thus, seeing themselves reflected as
though through a glass, brightly, perhaps they think to themselves,
""who is this jovial fellow, this man amongst men, this keen-eyed
rogue who sees me as the princely soul i am?"").<br />
<br />
i really have got to do something about the parentheticals -
footnotes would look stupid, so clearly drastic cuts are in order.
for now, suck it up until i fix it, wiki-edit it, or send me hate
mail about how terrible it is - i'll be impressed you read this far
down the page, either way. well done you! there will be a quiz at
the bottom.","i like to read mind-bending fiction (e.g. philip k. dick, some
borges, even huxley) that takes you to another mental place
entirely, i'll watch any movie that makes me feel different after
i've seen it, and i'll eat just about anything (not beets - i love
their flavor, but it would seem that i'm allergic to them; think
'exorcist,' or actually, don't).<br />
<br />
specifically, i love southern food in all its incarnations,
especially collards, beans, &amp; gumbo. i like fried cheese (it
sounds terrible, i know, but it's actually good for you if you fry
it in grapeseed oil, because it's better for you than cheese fat,
&amp; frying the cheese sort of clarifies it - plus, it's delicious
if you crisp the cheese on the outside &amp; serve it on crostini
with tomato salsa) and all sorts of things that aren't supposed to
be very good for you (no junk food, though - processed foods never
taste or feel that good to me). i could eat roast vegetables every
day, and fried collard greens with bacon &amp; peppers five times a
week.<br />
<br />
the last movies i saw in a theater were mulholland drive (don't
judge me, it was a retrospective), which i still find to be quite
thought-provoking, and john carter, which i enjoyed largely because
the 3d was excellent &amp; because i'm a long-time fan of edgar
rice burroughs. it doesn't belong in 'films,' but i'm so
exceedingly amused by the venture brothers series on adult swim
that i'm putting it here anyway. i would date someone solely
because they liked watching the venture brothers and futurama with
me, although i don't know how long that would last (about seventy
episodes, i guess).<br />
<br />
i don't have favorite music, just music that i listen to a lot at a
given time. once i start listening to an artist or a genre, i get
everything i can in that vein and listen it to death or until
something else catches my fancy. at the moment, it's led zeppelin
crossed with bootleg live fatboy slim &amp; aphex twin mixes,
ambient dub, and noise (that last is new - i'm not really feeling
it yet, but it comes recommended so i'm giving it time). i also
like grime &amp; uk dubstep imports, but as i say that i realize
it's getting harder &amp; harder to find good dubstep, as there's
so much tat put out by labels who are capitalizing on a stereotype
of the sound but not really encapsulating the feeling.","parenthetical remarks (judging by the above as samples).<br />

anyway.<br />
<br />
as an aside, i'm amused at how many people won't admit to having a
""typical friday night"" to write about -- at a certain level, i
think it bespeaks a little bit of denial (that you're as knowable
as everyone else) or perhaps a lack of
self-knowledge/self-examination if you can't look back &amp;
recognize your patterns; contrariwise, if you truly have no
patterns, that is in itself a little odd to me. i don't mind if
your pattern is ""go out &amp; do something that i've never done
before"" or even ""write a numbered list of the top results from a
google search of sf activities this weekend ... and then roll a
20-sided die"" but i suspect if you actually look at your life,
there probably is a pattern.<br />
<br />
(maybe i'm being too literal here. ahem.)","i get along really well with people who are many kinds of high
(though i tend to be almost straightedge). why is this private?
several times i have found myself at a party where i know a couple
of people but i seem to get along really, really well with everyone
- they seem to be a lot more like me than most people are, more
friendly, talkative, and upbeat than usual, and less rigid,
self-absorbed, or uptight. and i have thought to myself, ""these are
my people. i feel at home with these people, like just another one
of many rather than someone who is always a little bit different.""
when it becomes clear, later, either because someone makes it
obvious or perhaps a party-goer later mentions that the reason why
people seemed different that night from how they have been since is
because just about everyone else was high before i got there, it
makes me wonder - if i think those folks are like me, what am i
like?<br />
<br />
in the end, though, i realize it's just a thing i have to come to
terms with: i, like so many of you reading this, am just a little
bit different from most people - we're all unique individuals,
certainly, and although some of us may seem to be a bit more
unique, for some reason, the fact remains that this is the life you
have and your best option is to live it as well as you can. so be
it!","you think you're smart, interesting, heartful, curious, or fun to
spend an afternoon with. i'm looking to expand my circle of people
that i connect really well with, or even just find more folks who
like to do new things &amp; have more fun than they probably should
(according to their more boring friends).<br />
<br />
i admit (as you'll know, if you've read the foregoing), i'm not
short of friends &amp; people i'm currently not sending postcards
to or calling, so if we don't get along pretty well pretty quickly
then it might not work out, but i reckon it's worth coffee or cocoa
to find out.<br />

also - please message me if you have any suggestions for books or
music, either because you think i'd like them for some reason or
because you think so highly of something that you reckon everyone

outcomes).<br />

through a skymall catalog (part of you is interested, part of you
is embarrassed you are even looking. another part is waiting for
the in-flight movie to start). then, when one catches your eye you
take a closer look and check out the other photos. if you are still
interested, you may actually read the profile.<br />
ipso facto, if you are actually reading this that means that you
might want a little insight into who i am or where i got that
badass birthday mug.<br />
<br />
i think it's pretty hard to get to know someone just by reading a
few paragraphs they wrote about themselves (most likely after a few
drinks). i firmly believe in the power of chemistry and the way
certain people click and others just... don't. i'm merely
suggesting you don't judge someone by these asinine profiles, that
sometimes you need a real world meet up to find out they are
asinine.<br />
<br />
that being said, i'm honest, funny and creative. i'm intelligent,
down to earth, a little sarcastic, and a hopeless romantic who
doesn't think chivalry is dead. i will want to open the door for
you, pull your chair out for you, and pick up the tab. deal with
it.<br />
<br />
it seems like everyone on here loves hiking and snowboarding and
outdoor stuff. i'm not quite as into it as the next guy, but for
good reason. (see below)<br />
don't get me wrong, i'm totally up for doing that kind of thing
with the right person. (just last month someone got me climbing the
stanford dish) i love camping even though i haven't been in a long
time, it's just the hiking and climbing stuff that is tough for me
to handle. (again, see below) to be honest, i'd much rather just
chill out, cuddle and watch a movie. maybe get drunk and watch
cartoons. or maybe play chess or poker or jenga. i'm always up for
going out, but i do love a good quiet night at home.","right now i'm pretty much just working and taking care of my
daughter. i'm realizing there is a ton of stuff i still want to do,
that i need to branch out and try stuff outside of my comfort zone.

i started taking improv classes a while ago and i hope to be
perfoming with a group by the end of the year.<br />

laugh (i'm not above making a fool of myself), and i have this
weird color thing where my converse all-stars have to match the
rest of my clothes in some fashion (no pun intended).<br />
<br />
i can probably name that movie or actor you can't remember, or the
voice on that car commercial that you just... can't...
place...<br />
<br />
i have this odd talent of simplifing complex ideas to make them
easier to understand. this means i can teach almost anyone almost
anything (as long as i understand it)","","i had this all filled out with specific books, shows, movies, etc,
but really, isn't that what getting to know someone is about? i
like a lot, and if it's well writen/acted/performed, and makes me
feel feelings, i'll probably love it.<br />

guess that's true. i graduated at the bottom of my class with no
honors but decided to follow my passion anyways. i took a
prestigious apprenticeship at a penguin and yak herding ranch
located in iceland but the company was downsized due to global
warming so i was faced with a career decision. i've always loved
the idea of being lied to while getting shot at for performing an
unethical invasion of a country which was ultimately motivated by
profit and religious ignorance so.... i decided to join the army.
after i was done being all that i could be, i once again found
myself at a proverbial fork in the road of life. i decided to apply
to colleges and was accepted to every ivy league school but instead
opted to attend portland state university because of the fuego
burrito cart. once in school i had to decide what i wanted out of
life and after a few hours of sipping on creativity juice, i had an
epiphany. i've always had a crush on the tooth fairy and thought
that maybe if i became a dentist she would find me attractive. so
here i am, new to san francisco and in my first year at pacific

within the story line. good will hunting is a classic, i'll have
words with anyone who says otherwise....i'd like to say that i'm
only into foreign or indi films just because it sounds so much more
intelligent. the truth is that to me, it seems as though a good
number of them are intentionally shot from a shitty and over
elaborate perspective, ultimately muddling the general composition
of the piece and detracting from what could have been a really
great film. like anything in life, some are great and some are
